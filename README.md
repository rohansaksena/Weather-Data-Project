 # Weather Data Project 
 
The Weather Data Project is one of my first projects on Data Analysis
It is a time-series data set with per hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location.It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure and Conditions.  

##  Project outcomes:
####  We will be successfully answering a bunch of questions :

### Q.1 Check whether the data is sucessfully loaded or not
### Q.2 Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in data.
### Q.3 Number of times the weather is exactly clear
### Q.4 Find out the Null Values in our DataSet
### Q.5 Rename the column 'weather' to 'weather condition'
### Q.6 Calculate the mean visibility
### Q.7 Calculate the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data
### Q.8 Calculate the variance of 'Relative Humidity' in the data given
### Q.9 Find all instances when 'Wind Speed' is greater than 24 and 'Visibility is 25'
### Q.10 What is the mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'
### Q.11 What is the Minimum and Maximum value of each column against each 'weather condition'
### Q.12 Show all the records where 'weather condition' is Fog
### Q.13 Find all instances where 'Weather is clear' or 'visibility is above 40'
### Q.14 All instances when 'weather is clear' and 'relative humidity is greater than 50'
### or
### Visibility is above 40
