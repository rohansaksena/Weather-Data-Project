 # Weather Data Project 
 
The Weather Data Project is one of my first projects on Data Analysis
It is a time-series data set with per hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location.It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure and Conditions.  

<hr>
 
##  Project outcomes: We will be answering a bunch of questions :

### Check whether the data is sucessfully loaded or not
### Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in data.
### Number of times the weather is exactly clear
### Find out the Null Values in our DataSet
### Rename the column 'weather' to 'weather condition'
### Calculate the mean visibility
### Calculate the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data
### Calculate the variance of 'Relative Humidity' in the data given
### Find all instances when 'Wind Speed' is greater than 24 and 'Visibility is 25'
### What is the mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'
### What is the Minimum and Maximum value of each column against each 'weather condition'
### Show all the records where 'weather condition' is Fog
### Find all instances where 'Weather is clear' or 'visibility is above 40'
### All instances when 'weather is clear' and 'relative humidity is greater than 50'
### or
### Visibility is above 40
